Case Study 2: DDSAnalytics 

# Talent Analysis 

created by * [Jason Herbaugh](https://github.com/jherbaugh) 

## Purpose

The Client, "DDSAnalytics ," has hired me to conduct specific analysis to identify factors that lead to attrition, provide any interesting trends in the data and build a model to predict attrition and salary (seperately).

## Data
The Data Sets

* ['CaseStudy2-data.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/main/CaseStudy2-data.csv) - Soure data for talent management.

* ['Case2PredictionsClassifyEXAMPLE.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/Case2PredictionsClassifyEXAMPLE.csv) - Classification model example.
* ['Case2PredictionsRegressEXAMPLE.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/Case2PredictionsRegressEXAMPLE.csv) - Regression model example.

* ['CaseStudy2CompSetNoAttrition.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/CaseStudy2CompSet No Attrition.csv) - ValidationDataset with no attrition.
* ['CaseStudy2CompSetNoSalary.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/CaseStudy2CompSet No Salary.csv.csv) - ValidationDataset with no salary.

* ['Case2PredictionsHerbaughAttrition.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/Case2Predictions_Herbaugh Attrition.csv) - Output of my RF model for classification.
* ['Case2PredictionsHerbaughSalary.csv'](https://github.com/jherbaugh/CaseStudy2DDS/blob/main/Case2Predictions_Herbaugh Salary.csv) - Output of my RF model for regression.

## Analysis

1. Top three factors in the data that lead to attrition.

2. Interesting trends in the data (open ended).  

3.  Build and Deploy a Model to Predict Salary. Must used k-nn and/or Naive Bayes as well as others.  Sensitivity and Specificity must be greater than > 60%.

4.  Build and Deploy a Model to Classify Attrition Rates. Must used k-nn and/or Naive Bayes as well as others. Sensitivity and Specificity must be greater than > 60%.
    

### Details 
The primary focus of this project is to display skill in each step of the **Data Science Process**; 
1. Define the Goal 
2. Get the Data 
3. Clean the Data
4. Enrich the Data
5. Find insights and visualize
6. Deploy Machine Learning
7. Iterate âˆž

in order to **Interperate and Communicate** Findings with stake holders. 

### Conclusion
Based on my analysis, the three trend that contribute to employee attributions are x,y,z. 
Predict model
Classify model
